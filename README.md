# CAPSTONE
This was created for my senior capstone project at Upper Arlington High School in Upper Arlington, Ohio. 

It uses Gensim's Word2Vec library to explore word embeddings by making graphics (through PCA and t-SNE) and generating a custom thesaurus based on a list of adjectives.

View ```benProjectCode.py``` for the main Python Script. The code would probably be better suited for a Jupyter Notebook, as various sections are meant to be run discretely.
